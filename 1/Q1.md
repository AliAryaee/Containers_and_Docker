## Question 1: Deleting the Router and Routing Between Subnets (Figure 2)

### Explanation:

If we delete the router and its connections to the bridges, the nodes won't be able to route packets between the two subnets anymore. But we can still make them talk to each other in a couple of ways:

1. **Bridging the Subnets (Layer 2)**:
   - One way to get the two subnets connected is by bridging them. This will make the two subnets act like theyâ€™re part of the same network, so the nodes can communicate directly without needing routing. This is Layer 2 communication where everything is in the same broadcast domain.

2. **Using the Root Namespace (Layer 3)**:
   - If we still need to route traffic between the subnets, we can enable packet forwarding in the root namespace. This allows traffic to go from one subnet to another, kind of like a router, but without actually needing a physical router.

### Conclusion:
By either bridging the subnets or turning on packet forwarding in the root namespace, we can still send packets from one subnet to the other without needing the router.
