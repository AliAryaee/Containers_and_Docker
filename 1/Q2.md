## Question 2: Namespaces on Different Servers (Figure 3)

### Explanation:

If the namespaces are on different servers but can still communicate at Layer 2, here’s how it works:

1. **Layer 2 Connectivity**:
   - If the namespaces are connected through a virtual switch or bridge across the servers, they’ll be able to talk to each other as if they are on the same network, even though they’re on separate physical machines. This keeps the Layer 2 communication between them.

2. **Routing Between Subnets**:
   - Since the namespaces are on different servers, we need to make sure the servers know how to send traffic between the different subnets. We do this by setting up routing on the servers, so they can forward traffic to the right subnet.

### Conclusion:
When namespaces are on different servers connected by a virtual switch, they can still communicate at Layer 2. But for Layer 3 communication, we’ll need to set up routing between the servers to forward traffic correctly.
